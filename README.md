Input files for manuscript

—————————————————————————————————————————

This repository contains the scripts, input files, and workflow used to generate the slab surfaces, prepare the training dataset, train the machine-learning potentials (MLPs), and run the molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reported in our work.
